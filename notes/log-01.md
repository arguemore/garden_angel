# Progress Logs

I'm documenting my learnings from this project just in case it would come in handy in the future. I will express in detail errors I encountered and how I solved them.

Disclaimer: I have a Computer Science degree but it was only by the grace of God that I was able to get it. I suck at programming but am now re-learning everything and putting my whole pussy into it unlike when I did during my undergrad years. Note that the source being me in the logs below means I fucked around and found out.
