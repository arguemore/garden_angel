# Progress Logs

I'm documenting my learnings from this project just in case it would come in handy to someone in the future. I will express in detail errors I encountered and how I solved them.

**Disclaimer:** I have a Computer Science degree but it was only by the grace of God that I was able to get it. I suck at programming but am now re-learning everything unlike when I did during my undergrad years. Note that the source being me in the logs below means I f!cked around and found out.
